## Features

- Automatically tracks character status and the current map

## Current Limitations

Currently, Path of Exile 2 doesn't have a character API, so the app relies on previous log files. This means when you switch accounts, it might show the wrong character until that character levels up.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement character API (when it releases)
- [ ] Add tray icon and remove console window
